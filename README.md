This project was created for carp anglers and fish enthusiasts in Hungary who want quick access to reliable information about lakes, fish species, and carp data.
The goal is to present clear, organised details that help users learn about fish and choose suitable fishing locations.
Target Audience:
Carp anglers, fish hobbyists, and anyone interested in Hungarian fish and lake information.

UX design
The UX design focused on presenting fish and carp information in a clear and simple way.
Basic wireframes were created to plan the layout, showing where the lake names, fish data and images would appear.
The final design follows these wireframes: clean sections, readable text, and a layout that works on both desktop and mobile.

Testing
The project was tested on different devices and screen sizes to make sure everything shows correctly.
A few small problems were found, like text overlapping and spacing issues, but these were fixed by updating the CSS.
There are no major bugs left — only some very small visual differences on older devices, which do not affect how the site works.

Deployment 
The project was published using GitHub Pages.
All project files were uploaded to a GitHub repository, and GitHub Pages was turned on in the repository settings.
After enabling it, the website became available through the link provided by GitHub Pages.
